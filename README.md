# Data Science Intern in Cybertrend Data Academy

This repository is a documentation of the MBKM program or Kampus Merdeka internship. During this internship, I was directly guided by professional mentors related to data analysis, visualization and data analytics with tableau, excel for data analysis, data science methodology and analysis, basic algorithms for data science, python for data science, soft skills for professionals. This repository contains several data science assignments and final projects that actually solve real-world cases.
